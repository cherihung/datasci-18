While no variable has an overwhelming colinearity (-1 or 1) with each other or with admit, the **presitge** factor has a comparatively higher colinearity value than GRE and GPA to admission status and has little colinearity with those two variables. This formed our initial hypothesis that Prestige can be used as a predictor for admission.\n",
