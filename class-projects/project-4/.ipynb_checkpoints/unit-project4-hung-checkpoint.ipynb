    "**Colinearity analysis** was then performed to determine which factors may have a correlation with the admit outcome. While no variable has an overwhelming colinearity (-1 or 1) with each other or with admit, the **presitge** factor has a comparatively higher colinearity value than GRE and GPA to admission status and has little colinearity with those two variables. This formed our initial hypothesis that Prestige can be used as a predictor for admission.\n",

    "The model developed from the UCLA dataset shows that an applicant from a lower-ranked undergraduate school faces a tougher chance of being admitted regardless of how well he/she scored on the GRE or had performed in school (i.e. GPA score). Assuming the model holds true, it is somewhat disheartening that the postive effect of a neutral and standardized evaluation factor such the GRE score is not higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this model isn't terribly surprising, the postiive correlation is clear enough that can now be fine-tuned by running against a larger dataset from the real world. And see how ot still fits or holds. Given this model is based on a small set of data points, when fitting to real-world data, it is likely to be too simplified or underfitting because of that. A significant issue to consider is how to assign the prestige ranks to new data points. We do not have a guideline on how prestige were created for this UCLA dataset. So a natural next step is to either find the guideline/algorithm or to somehow establish one ourselves. And then re-train our model accordingly."
