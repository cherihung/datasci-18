    "\n",
    "4. Pull out the rows of data of students who were admitted (admit = 1). Find the median and use that to formulate the null hypothesis. For example, the null hypothesis can be formulated as \"600 is the median GRE score for all students admitted. Therefore, any student with a GRE score above 600 is highly likely to be admitted.\" \n",

    "6. If null hypothesis continues to hold true after tests, we still have to take into account of colinearity. The correlation matrix we previously ran should provide insight here. Collinearity almost always exist. For example, in our dataset, GRE and GPA both have a 0.18 colinearity to admit and a medium colinearity (about 0.38) to each other. So we should run more tests based on GPA factor to see if a null hypothesis based on a median GPA can also be used. "
